Direct3D hooking research
=========================
This repository contains the source code to my research into hooking via vtable injection and obtaining Direct3D output.
At current, the code only works with DirectX 9.

D3DLauncher is a program to run a program and inject the specified dll into the program's process space
D3DHook is the dll where all the function hooking is performed
